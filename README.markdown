# Days Since

An Android Widget that shows the number of days since New Years and also shows how many photos you have in a certain Flickr set. The aim is to use this as a quick tool to check how many pictures one should have in the project365 photo set by todays date.

## Road map

###v.0.1.0 (released)
- Show days since New years in a widget

###v.0.2.0

- Implement Flickr API calls to fetch list of photos in hard coded Flickr set
- Show both days since New years and number of photos in Widget screen

###v.0.3.0
- Make set and user details configurable through config activity
